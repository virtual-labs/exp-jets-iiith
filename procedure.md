## Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Click/Tap on the Start button to start the experiment.  
2. The water shall start flowing through the pipe. The level in the jet shall start rising.  
3. The watter will go through the nozzle and hit the flat plate and displace the scale.
4. Try to change the flow speed by using Control flow speed glider. Bringing the glider to the left will slow down the water flow whereas bringing it to the right will speed it up!  
5. The Control flow speed glider is dynamic and can be changed midway when the water is filling up too.  
6. Click/Tap on the Reset button to restart the expeirment afresh, i.e., with empty apparatus.
